  ## Project Description
this project uses Java, it is compiled of sorting algorithms for geometric shapes. It provides and efficient way of sorting object based on properties such as height, base area, and volume

  ## Features
Program includes the following methods for sorting:

  -bubble
  
  -insertion
  
  -selection
  
  -merge
  
  -quick
  
  -heap
  
Ability to sort geometric shaped based on their properties

simple command line interface for program use

## Requirements
- Java 11 or higher

# Installation Instructions
To access this program, it can be found directly from the public Github repository, and downloaded via zip file. Extract this zip to your local machine.  
1. save the code to a local path on your machine
2. open command line, enter prompt "java -jar Sort.jar -f**file_name** -t**v** -s**b**

   after -t,
   
         input v for volume
         
         h for height
         
         b forbase area

   
   after -s, use first letter abbreviation for the sort method you wish to use
   
           b (bubble)
         
           i (insertion)
         
           s (selection)
         
           m (merge)
         
           q (quick)
         
           z (heap)
